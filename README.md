## 1. Graphs showing the benchmark results wih the explanation of experimental setting

### 1.a Single client with a small call to insert a book item

### 1.a A bigger call to insert a list of multiple book items

### 1.b Multiple clients with different kind of calls

### 1.c Vary thte number of concurrent calls from 1 to 4096 calls

## 2. Discussion of the results why one method is better the other in which scenarios

## 3. Comparison of the gRPC and REST API from the aspects of language neutral, ease of use, and performance

## 4. Does results comply with the results in https://medium.com/@bimeshde/grpc-vs-rest-performance-simplified-fd35d01bbd4
